 <h1>Dragon Boat Festival</h1>
</div>
<div class="des">
 <p>Dragon Boat Festival usually happens in June, and although on the decline in modern times, still has some exciting traditions to experience. For example, there is dragon boat racing, which is now also an international sport. 
In terms of traditional Dragon Boat Festival food, there are zongzi. These are millet flour dumplings wrapped in wild rice leaves in the shape of ox horns, cooked in bamboo. People in the south of China eat mostly savory zongzi, but in Beijing they are usually sweet.

</div>
<div class="des">
 <p>Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Chunjie in Chinese, is the biggest holiday throughout China and celebrated on the first day of the lunar calendar (usually between January 21 and February 20). 
It is also a prime time to visit Beijing and experience the local culture, with traditional visits to temples, celebrations in bars and at festivals. The Temple Fairs are wonderful places to visit to learn about Chinese New Year and Chinese culture in general. And then we haven't even mentioned all the fireworks throughout Beijing!

 <h1>Red Leaf Festival at Fragrant Hill </h1>
</div>
<div class="des">
 <p>Red Leaf Festival is celebrated at different times at different parts of Fragrant Hill, as the leaves turn red. At Jingcui Lake, you're best off watching between October 25 and November 9, while at Fragrant Hill Temple, you will catch the leaves between October 18 and November 2. The leaves at Heshun Gate turn even later, around October 25 and November 9. 
As the hill gets really busy in this season, you are advised to visit on a weekday rather than during the weekends.

Beijing Mid-Autumn Festival </h1>
</div>
<div class="des">
 <p>Mid-Autumn Festival, generally celebrated in September, is a moon worshipping festival which includes the offering of mooncakes and sometimes fruits, and watching the moon. 
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, peaches and pomegranates are laid out with chestnuts and persimmons symbolizing big families and prosperity. 
The best way to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival in Beijing is at a temple fair at the Marco Polo bridge, from the CCTV Tower, or from one of the many lakes and parks which have a clear view of the sky.The early form of the Festival was derived from the custom of moon worship during the Zhou Dynasty over 3,000 years ago.
